# Botball Game 2020

This repository holds:

 - The code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's 2020 Botball game strategy (`master` branch)
 - A project template for other teams to use (`template` branch)

We developed and are using [Botball for Python](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball) as the backbone for our code. It's open source and we encourage other teams to use it and contribute!

## The `master` branch

The `master` branch contains **our team's code** for **our strategy** in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use of the `master` branch:

 - Viewing the contents of the `master` branch is allowed for guidance and inspiration only, and not for use or incorporation into your robotics team's program.
 - After July 2020, all code in the `master` branch is available to other teams under the MIT License.
 - Members of the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team always have access under the MIT License.

## The `template` branch

The `template` branch contains a sample template for creating a new Botball for Python project with a structure similar to ours. It is free to use under the MIT License for everyone, and we encourage other robotics teams to use it and contribute!

Please read the [Botball for Python documentation](https://tyngsboroughrobotics.github.io/botball/) for information on how to get started with the template.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions that are in compliance with the above terms, and encourage you to check out our work with [Botball for Python](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball)!

# Quick project setup

See the  [documentation](https://tyngsboroughrobotics.github.io/botball/) for detailed instructions.

1. Install Pycharm, Git and Make for your operating system (Windows or macOS). Chromebooks are not supported.

2. Clone this repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/game2020.git`

3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and type `make init && make update-botball`. These commands download the latest version of Botball for Python to your computer and provide PyCharm type hints.

4. Open the project folder in PyCharm and allow it to index. Install all required plugins; they'll appear in a popup in the bottom right.

5. Connect your robot controller start hacking! When you're ready to deploy to the robot, click "deploy" from the top-right dropdown menu and then the green Play button.
