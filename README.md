This repository holds the code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's Botball game strategy.

We developed and are using the [Botball for Python](botball) library to write our code. The library is open source and we encourage other teams to use it and contribute!

## Viewing and using our code

The code in this repository contains *our team's code* for *our strategy* in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be cheating and against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use of this repository, which you can read [here](LICENSE).

## Running on your Wombat

Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed on your Wombat (for other, newer versions, edit the `bin/botball_user_program` file). Connect to your Wombat over WiFi and run `python run_on_robot.py`. The contents of the repository will be zipped, sent over SSH to the robot, and executed.

To change the configuration (including the IP address and password of the Wombat), edit `run_on_robot.py`.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to [Botball for Python](botball) â€” feel free to submit an issue or pull request!
