# Botball Game 2020

This repository holds the code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's 2020 Botball game strategy.

We developed and are using the [Botball for Python](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball) library to write our code. The library is open source and we encourage other teams to use it and contribute!

## Viewing and using our code

The code in this repository contains **our team's code** for **our strategy** in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be cheating and against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots.
