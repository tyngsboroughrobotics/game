# Botball Game 2020

This repository holds the code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's 2020 Botball game strategy.

We developed and are using the [Botball for Python](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball) library to write our code. It's open source and we encourage other teams to use it and contribute!

## The `master` branch

The `master` branch contains **our team's code** for **our strategy** in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use of the `master` branch:

 - Viewing the contents of the `master` branch is allowed for guidance and inspiration only, and not for use or incorporation into your robotics team's program.
 - After July 2020, all code in the `master` branch is available to other teams under the MIT License.
 - Members of the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team always have access under the MIT License.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions that are in compliance with the above terms, and encourage you to check out our work with [Botball for Python](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball)!
