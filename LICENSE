The code in this repository contains our team's code for our strategy in the
Botball competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration,
it would be cheating and against the spirit of the game to directly use our code
for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use
of the code contained in this repository:

1. Viewing the contents of the `game/` folder, which contains our strategy, is
   allowed for guidance and inspiration only, and not for use or incorporation
   into your robotics team's code. The rest of the repository, including
   configuration files and Botball for Python, is available under the MIT
   License.

2. After July 31, 2020, all code from commits up to that date is available for
   everyone to view and use under the MIT License. Since we may use this
   repository for another strategy in the future, files changed by commits made
   after that date are subject to clause 1. Please check the commit log to
   verify which files were changed and when.

3. Members of the Tyngsborough High School Robotics Team always have access to
   all files under the MIT License.
